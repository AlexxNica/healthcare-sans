# Healthcare Sans

**A typeface designed to meet the needs of health services and the wider healthcare sector.** This is my first attempt at creating a typeface. The project will be a learning experience for me, which I’ll document in this repository.

If you have feedback or suggestions about the project, contact me on Twitter [@bathtype](https://twitter.com/bathtype) or by email at [dan@danleech.com](mailto:dan@danleech.com).
